# emacs

This is my Emacs literate configuration file. It is transpiled to `elisp` at build time.

Note, I'm currently lazy. I manually symlink `init.el` to `~/.emacs`. This means my Emacs configuration is *not immutable* nor very reproducible. However, it works. I rarely touch `init.el`, and changes to `Emacs.org` are versioned.

I hope to get around to nix-ifying this configuration soon.
